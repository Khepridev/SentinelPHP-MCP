# How to Deploy Documentation

This documentation is built with static HTML, CSS, and JS. You can host it completely for free using **GitHub Pages**.

## Quick Steps

1.  **Push to GitHub**: Ensure this `docs/` folder is committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.
2.  **Go to Settings**: Open your repository on GitHub and click on the **Settings** tab.
3.  **Pages Section**: On the left sidebar, scroll down and click on **Pages**.
4.  **Configure Source**:
    *   Under **Build and deployment**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
    *   Under **Branch**, select your `main` branch.
    *   **IMPORTANT**: Select the **`/docs`** folder (not /root).
    *   Click **Save**.

## That's it!
In a few moments, GitHub will provide you with a URL (e.g., `https://khepridev.github.io/SentinelPHP-MCP/`).
